---Welcome to the new SSS Blog.

Why a new blog, when the existing one works fine?

The main reason is that since I feel confident about my coding abilities in several different "traditional" programming languages, I'm now interested in working in more web-centric languages and frameworks. I've always put off learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because they seemed _clunky_ and obtuse. But I've realized that whereas ten years ago the desktop was everything, now the web (and mobile apps) are king.

In addition, I've always found WordPress (which I use for the existing SSS Blog) to be overkill for what I want to do with the blog. It's a wonderful framework for folks with no programming or technical skills, but that comes with a cost in terms of size and speed.

More and more sites are turning away from the traditional paradigm (which requires building web sites and pages anew each time they are requested) to a new one called the JAMStack. The idea behind the JAMStack is to generate websites and pages that are largely _static_ -- that is, they aren't built anew each time someone requests them. This makes the sites much faster. Frameworks that work with the JAMStack also allow for the creation of content in "Markdown," a framework that can provide much of what clunky old HTML does with a much cleaner, simpler syntax.
